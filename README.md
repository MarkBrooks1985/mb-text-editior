# MB Text Editor

## Description

For this challenge we had to complete a starter code that would be a text editor that can work both online and offline. The Application uses a variety of dta to ensure data is not lost. It first looks up data in the indexed Database to populate the editor. If it can't access it, it will use local storage. This application can be donwloaded/installed for use offline to your desktop. This app solves the problem of being a helpful tool for developers if they want to continue snippets of code if their internet connection is down.
